For instance, it is blamed for headphone cables tangling when left in a bag. If we consider two macro-states of a headphone cable: tangled and untangled, then think about possible micro-states, i.e. every possible arrangement they could conceivably be forced into, it is evident that there are more ways that the cable can exist in a tangled state than untangled. Therefore, if allowed to move randomly (even a little) amongst other contents in a bag, they become tangled.\nIn the context of statistics, information entropy can be used to work with uncertainty. Methods of Maximising Entropy (MaxEnt), conditional on some given costraints, produce models that are most likely to be consistent with future observations. These arguments are used to support modelling choices in statistical decision analysis. Information theory is also the basis for various methods of evaluating the relative performance of competing models.\n\rThermodynamic Entropy\rAs an engineering undergraduate student, I was taught about entropy in the context of thermodynamics. The reason processes like expanding steam through a turbine are irreversible is because they are not isentropic. They are associated with an increase in entropy, and a the entropy of a system can never decrease.\nInclude picture of a T-s diagram\rWhat is an isentropic process? (A reversible process)\nNot possible -\u0026gt; second law of thermodynamics.\nSlight digression, but will pay off soon:\nQuantitative case: moving molecules.\nWhat is the system? What are possible macro-states? What are possible micro-states?\nHow many different ways can each macro-state exist? Depends on the number of possible micro-states!\rThe most likely outcome in such a stochastic process is the outcome that can occur in the most ways. This is the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) solution.\nUnless some energy is put into the system to encourage a particular macro-state, the MaxEnt argument is the best bet.\nfor \\(N\\) gas molecules each of a distinct energy level, \\(E\\), where \\(p_{i}\\) is the proportion of molecules with energy \\(E_{i}\\)\n\\[\rS = -k \\cdot \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{E} p_{i} \\cdot log(p_{i})\r\\]\nThe above expression can be used to maximise \\(S\\).\nThis sort of description of entropy is no longer restricted to thermodynamic systems and can also be applied to uncertainty.\n\rInformation Entropy\rInformation theory is the formal framework for modelling uncertainty. Claude Shannon is regarded as a pioneer in the field, describing how information is communicated mathematically. His work became the basis for modern telecommunication systems.\n\\[\rH = -k \\cdot \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} p_{i} \\cdot log(p_{i})\r\\]\nlooks familiar, right?\nThe best introductions to information entropy that I have read are in books by I.Jordaan, R.McElreath and E.T. Jaynes, who each provide helpful anaologies.\nAnalogy 1 (McElreath)\rJaynes uses the example of morbid children’s word-game hangman.\nMcElreath suggests an experiment where ten balls are randomly placed in five buckets, and evaluates a few different arrangements.\nThe two extremes are:\r* All ten balls are placed in a single bucket (e.g Bucket 1 of 5): There is only one way of achieving this.\r* Two balls are placed in each of the five buckets: There are 113400 ways of achieving this.\n\rAnalogy 2 (Jordaan)\rJordaan proposes a simple definition of entropy:\n‘Entropy is the smallest expected number of YES–NO questions to determine the true event.’\n…which I think can be interpretted as the complexity of a system.\nHe elaborates on this idea by imagining an entropy demon playing games. In one instance, he plays a game of roulette many times.\nIn each of the above examples we are relating information to a count of possible system states.\n\r\rMaxEnt Statistical Models\rMaxEnt methods are also used in ecology, and J. Harte and E. Newman have written an introduction, which also includes statistical distributions which are MaxEnt solutions for some given constraints.\nIf we were to bet on the outcome of the number of balls in each of McElreath’s buckets, the optimal way to do so would be to use a uniform distribution. The MaxEnt solution (the macro state consistent with the largest number of possible micro-states) is a uniform distribution. Selecting any other distribution to model the probability of the number of balls in the buckets\nBayesian Inference as an extension of MaxEnt methodology …\nA discussion on Bayesian models will follow.\n# We can read a text file using \u0026#39;readLines\u0026#39; and we can select a file interactively using \u0026#39;file.choose\u0026#39;\r# Both of these are Base R functions\rpaper \u0026lt;- readLines(file.choose())\rMaxEnt in ecology\nCongratulations on making it to the end!\n(GIF Source link, accessed Sep 17, 2019)\r\rXKCD license\n\r","date":1560211200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560242887,"objectID":"a13221023060a11f26fdf5ca0eb000a3","permalink":"/post/2019-06-11-conceptual-introduction-information/","publishdate":"2019-06-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-06-11-conceptual-introduction-information/","section":"post","summary":"TLDR\rEntropy is used synonymously with disorder.

However, the below is a purely gimmicky example that simply demonstrates some of the functionality of the gganimate library.\n\rMaking Moving Plots with gganimate\rGraphics made using the ggplot2 package are already extremely customisable. They can be further enhanced using some of the extensions that have been developed. These include providing access to new themes, as well as entirely new functionality.\ngganimate allows for the animation of existing ggplot graphics. Once installed, we can load both packages (ggplot2 is included as part of the tidyverse):\nlibrary(gganimate); library(tidyverse)\rThe example uses a fifa 19 dataset that I found on Kaggle.\nsize \u0026lt;- 500\rfifa19 \u0026lt;- fifa19 %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(Overall))\rtopPlayers \u0026lt;- fifa19[1:size,]\rThe above filter defines the topPlayers dataframe as the highest rated 500 players on the game.\nHowever, it still has a lot of columns, and we are not interested in them all for now:\nparams \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#39;Name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Overall\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;NumValue\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;NumWage\u0026#39;)\rtopPlayers \u0026lt;- topPlayers %\u0026gt;% select(params)\rBelow shows how we can use ggplot to create a scatterplot comparing the transfer value and weekly wage of the players.\nBecause I want to label some of the most valuable and highest earning players I will use an additional ggplot extension, ggrepel. The function geom_text_repel() from this library differs from ggplot’s geom_text() in that it prevents text labels from overlapping with each other (where possible).\nminValueToLabel \u0026lt;- 75; minWageToLabel \u0026lt;- 300\rtopPlayersPlot \u0026lt;- ggplot(topPlayers)+\rgeom_point(aes(x = NumValue, y = NumWage), alpha = 0.5)+\rggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(x = NumValue, y = NumWage, label = Name), data = subset(topPlayers, NumValue \u0026gt; minValueToLabel | NumWage \u0026gt; minWageToLabel),\rseed = 1008, size = 3, family = \u0026#39;Trebuchet MS\u0026#39;)+\rxlab(\u0026#39;Player Value, $M\u0026#39;)+ylab(\u0026#39;Player Weekly Wage, $k\u0026#39;)+\rtheme_bw(base_size = 9)\rtopPlayersPlot\rThe text label effectively includes a filter by specifying a subset of data. Only players with a value of at least $75\rM, or a weekly wage of at least $300 k.\nThis plot is the basis for the animation.\nAdding a function from gganimate and saving as a new variable:\ntopPlayersPlotAnim \u0026lt;- topPlayersPlot +\rtransition_states(states = Overall, transition_length = 1, state_length = 4, wrap = FALSE)+\rggtitle(\u0026#39;Fifa 19 Top Rated Players\u0026#39;, subtitle = \u0026#39;Overall Rating = {closest_state}\u0026#39; )\rtransition_states() requires specification of the discrete states that the plot animate sequentially. As shown above, this animation will transition through values of Overall i.e. the overall player rating.\nThere are numerous alternative types of transition within gganimate as detailed here. Each of these accept some additional arguments to describe the animation.\nIn this case, transition_length and state_length describe the relative amount of time spent displaying the current state, and transitioning to the next state.\nFinally, if wrap is set to TRUE, the animation will also transition from the final state back to the first state.\nThis example is certainly not exaustive and there are many additional tweaks available to further customise an animation. Some of those examples are shown in the official beginner’s guide.\nRegardless of the transition function selected, the best way to create the moving plot is to use the animate function:\nanimate(plot = topPlayersPlotAnim, fps = 20, duration = 60, end_pause = 60)\rThe animate() function requires us to specify the plot (to be animated), but includes many additional arguments not all of which are detailed above.\nfps is the frames per second, duration is the length of the animation (in seconds), and end_pause is the length of time that the final frame is held for (in number of frames.)\nI tried a few alternatives here, In this case each state has quite a few points and so I wanted it to be held for a reasonable amount of time. However, it does result in a total of 1200 frames in the animation. On my laptop this required approximately 3 minutes to render. A shorter animation could be produced in a few seconds.\nFinal Animation\n\rOnce you are happy with your animation you can save it (in various formats) using anim_save().\nA note on animating text or label geoms from the ggrepel library:\nAfter my first attempt at this excercise my labels were jumping around erratically, though always in a similar position. As I found out on stackoverflow, this is because the position of the text was being assigned stochastically and was therefore being re-assigned in each frame.\rSetting the seed value means the position will be the same in each frame. This is done in the geom_text_repel() function.\n\r","date":1559606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559656867,"objectID":"9bf88e7a8c06ed5dff7fe1c6e16fcc3c","permalink":"/post/animating-plots/","publishdate":"2019-06-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/animating-plots/","section":"post","summary":"TLDR\rThere are many instances where it may be useful to animate graphical representations of data, perhaps to add an additional dimension to a plot.
