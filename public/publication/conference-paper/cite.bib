abstract = {Engineers use semi-empirical models of complex degra- dation phenomena to manage the integrity of structural systems. Historically, the intended application of these models has been to perform deterministic calculations to demonstrate that failure is not expected. However, as integrity management systems are in- creasingly optimised decision makers require quantified likelihoods of events such as failure to help ensure that maintenance invest- ments are completed where and when they are worthwhile. In the probabilistic application of degradation models, inherent and un-quantified conservatism can lead to ineffective risk manage- ment. Bayesian analysis can be used to fit semi-empirical degra- dation models to existing test data (and can be updated if new data is available) such that the variability within, and the inter-de- pendency between all model parameters is quantified. This in- cludes model uncertainty parameters. In this paper, an SN curve and a two-stage Paris Law model have been fitted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. The bene- fits and challenges associated with this approach are discussed in the context of existing standards and guidelines developed for in- dustry. Posterior predictive sampling is used to demonstrate how the models can be used to produce results that are fully compati- ble with a Bayesian decision analysis.},
