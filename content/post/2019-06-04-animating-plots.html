<div id="tldr" class="section level3">
<h3>TLDR</h3>
<p>There are many instances where it may be useful to animate graphical representations of data, perhaps to add an additional dimension to a plot. The below example builds a cumulative map of car accidents in the UK using some of the functionality of the <code>gganimate</code> <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gganimate">package</a>.</p>

<h3>Making Moving Plots with <code>gganimate</code></h3>
<p>Graphics made using the <code>ggplot2</code> package are already extremely customisable. They can be further enhanced using some of the <a href="http://ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/">extensions that have been developed</a>. These include providing access to new themes, as well as entirely new functionality.</p>
<p><code>gganimate</code> allows for the animation of existing ggplot graphics. Once installed, we can load both packages (<code>ggplot2</code> is included as part of the <code>tidyverse</code>):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(gganimate); library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<p>The example uses a car accident dataset that I found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/silicon99/dft-accident-data/data#">Kaggle</a>. Here are the first few rows of the variables that we’re interested in:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(Accidents_Dec2015 %&gt;% 
       dplyr::select(Date, Longitude, Latitude, Number_of_Casualties, Accident_Severity))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##         Date Longitude Latitude Number_of_Casualties Accident_Severity
## 1 2015-12-01 -0.155880 51.48959                    1            Slight
## 2 2015-12-01 -0.200271 51.49262                    1            Slight
## 3 2015-12-03 -0.210643 51.49997                    2            Slight
## 4 2015-12-03 -0.156754 51.49293                    1            Slight
## 5 2015-12-03 -0.159124 51.50205                    1            Slight
## 6 2015-12-04 -0.197452 51.49104                    1            Slight</code></pre>
<p>We can plot the coordinates using a map of the UK included in <code>ggplot2</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>UK_coords &lt;- ggplot2::map_data(map = &#39;world&#39;, region = &#39;UK&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Before animating we need to create a ggplot that we will work from.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>accidents_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = UK_coords)+
  geom_polygon(mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), col = &#39;black&#39;, fill = NA)+
  theme_void(base_size = 12, base_family = &#39;Bahnschrift&#39;)+
  geom_point(data = Accidents_Dec2015, 
             mapping = aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, col = as.factor(Accident_Severity), 
                           alpha = as.factor(Accident_Severity), size = Number_of_Casualties,
             group = seq_len(length.out = nrow(Accidents_Dec2015))))+
  theme(legend.position = &#39;right&#39;)+
  scale_size_continuous(breaks = c(1, 3, 9))+
  scale_color_manual(values = c(&#39;firebrick&#39;, &#39;forestgreen&#39;, &#39;steelblue&#39;))+
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(0.4, 0.2, 0.1), guide = &#39;none&#39;)+
  guides(col = guide_legend(title = element_blank(), ncol = 1),
         size = guide_legend(title = element_text(&#39;Casualties&#39;, size = 10), ncol = 1, alpha = 0.4))

accidents_plot</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-06-04-animating-plots_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can now add some functions from <code>gganimate</code>, which will describe how and saving as a new variable:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(gganimate)

accidents_plot &lt;- accidents_plot +
  transition_time(time = Date)+
  enter_grow()+
  shadow_mark()+
  ggtitle(label = &#39;UK Car Accidents in December 2015&#39;, subtitle = &#39;Date : {frame_time}&#39;)+
  labs(caption = &#39;Data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/silicon99/dft-accident-data/data |  @Domenic_DF&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><code>transition_time()</code> requires specification of a time variable that the plot will display sequentially. As shown above, this animation will transition through values of <code>Date</code>. There are many more options that allow for animation across different data types in different ways.</p>
<p><code>shadow_mark()</code> has been added to keep accidents from previous dates. Again, there are various methods of showing data from previous states.</p>
<p><code>enter_grow()</code> means that when new data first appear on the plot, they will emerge by growing into their final size.</p>
<p>Some of these additional options are detailed <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gganimate">here</a>.</p>
<p>In this case, <code>transition_length</code> and <code>state_length</code> describe the <strong>relative</strong> amount of time spent displaying the current state, and transitioning to the next state.</p>
<p>Regardless of the transition function selected, the best way to create the moving plot is to use the <code>animate</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>animate(plot = accidents_plot, fps = 20, duration = 30, end_pause = 100)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>animate()</code> function requires us to specify the plot (to be animated), but includes many additional arguments not all of which are detailed above.</p>
<p><code>fps</code> is the frames per second, <code>duration</code> is the length of the animation (in seconds), and <code>end_pause</code> is the length of time that the final frame is held for (in number of frames.)</p>
</div>
<div id="final-animation" class="section level3">
<h3>Final Animation</h3>
<p>I tried a few alternatives here. In this case each state has quite a few points and so I wanted it to be held for a reasonable amount of time. The trade-off here is the number of frames (and associated processing time and file size). The below allocates approximately <code>1</code> second per day and results in a total of 600 frames for the animation. On my (ageing) laptop this required approximately 4 minutes to render.</p>

<div id="thoughts-on-the-animation" class="section level3">
<h3>Thoughts on the Animation</h3>
<p>What does the animation tell us that the stationary plot doesn’t?</p>
<p>The final frame is pretty much identical, but the transitions will show when the accidents occurred. From viewing the animation there doesn’t appear to be a clear time when accidents were more frequent. We can check this with an additional plot:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Accidents_Dec2015 %&gt;% 
     dplyr::select(Date, Number_of_Casualties, Accident_Severity) %&gt;% 
     ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Date))+
        geom_bar(stat = &#39;count&#39;, fill = &#39;grey80&#39;)+
        facet_wrap(facets = ~ Accident_Severity, scales = &#39;free&#39;)+
        theme_ddf_light()+
        coord_flip()+
        theme(axis.title = element_blank())</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-06-04-animating-plots_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>What isn’t shown in the data is the number of cars that were on the road at the time, so it could be that there were a higher proportion of accidents between the <code>24</code>th and <code>31</code>st December - but that will have to remain speculation for now.</p>
<p>One tip that I picked up from the <a href="https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate/">package developer</a> was the need to group data in the geom to avoid new points <em>travelling</em> from the location of other points. Given the context of the plot, that could have been interpreted as the same vehicles having accidents all over the UK. I’m glad that I was able to avoid this ambiguity in the plot.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think the animated plot looks cool, but it is perhaps a little gimmicky for this particular application. The same information is contained in the two static plots in this post. However, I hope this has content serves as a helpful introduction to how the <code>gganimate</code> package can automate animated graphics.</p>

<h3>Additional Resources</h3>
<p>This example is certainly not exhaustive and there are many additional tweaks available to further customise an animation. I have personally found the below resources to be particularly helpful.</p>
